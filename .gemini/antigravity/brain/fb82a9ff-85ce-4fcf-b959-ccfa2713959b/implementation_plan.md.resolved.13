# Implementation Plan - Advanced Media Integration (Phase 6)

## Goal Description
Allow users to watch movie trailers directly within the application without leaving the interface.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Implement Trailer Integration
#### [NEW] [src/components/modals/TrailerModal.tsx]
- Create a modal that accepts a `videoId` (YouTube ID).
- Embed a strict `iframe` pointing to `https://www.youtube.com/embed/${videoId}`.
- Styling: Dark backdrop, responsive aspect ratio (16:9).

#### [MODIFY] [src/components/modals/MovieEditorModal.tsx]
- Add a "Play Trailer" button next to the movie title/poster.
- **Logic:**
    - If `tmdbId` exists, call TMDB API endpoint `/movie/{id}/videos`.
    - Filter results for `site: "YouTube"` and `type: "Trailer"`.
    - If found, open `TrailerModal`.
    - If not found, show toast/alert.

## Verification Plan
1. **Search:** Select a popular movie (e.g., "Inception").
2. **Action:** Click "Ver Trailer".
3. **Expectation:** Modal opens, YouTube video loads and plays.
4. **Mobile:** Verify the modal is responsive and doesn't break layout on small screens.
